    <p >The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon .<br> Over time, text direction became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common.</p> 
    <p>The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.</p>

I want to absorb much of the knowledge and sharpen my abilities.My greatest strength is my ability to <span style="color:darkkhaki">learn things quickly and always ready to take a challenge</span>.<p style="color:slategray">Well, I have not so much weakness but I am shrinking after speaking to someone at the time of fighting or prove my points in front of anyone.
